<h1>Welcome to my page!</h1>
<p>Hello, there! My name is Yusra Iqbal. I am very enthusiastic about learning new things in IT and Computer Science, as it intrests me how things work and how they are made.
This is my first time learning how to use github. I hope to share the projects that I am passionate about with others. Just like everyone else, my first time learning, I make a lot of errors. I hope to share my journey with you as I continue to learn.</p>

<p>This feedback page using emojis is something I have been working on. It is not complete yet, however, I have added it to practice using Github. I plan to try my best to perfect this project and make new projects as I continue to learn.</p>
